AutoBroadcasterPlus
===================

Scheduled announcer plugin
Has a customizable and easy to use config, and a messages.txt file to store messages.
Formatting for any config uses the basic Minecraft formatting codes, available here: http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Formatting_codes

Any message (or even the announcer name) can have the player name receiving it on it, by writing %player% in the message.
